# Presentations
I use this repository to store my public presentations. I store each of these in a folder in this repository.

## List of Presentations

* [Container Camp Virtual - May 2020](./container-camp-virtual-2020)
* [Docker Auckland Meetup - Sept 2015](./docker-auckland-meetup-sept-2015)

### Use of Reveal.js
To prevent the need to update presentations continuously, you should create new presentations by including the relevant version of [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) in the content folder.
